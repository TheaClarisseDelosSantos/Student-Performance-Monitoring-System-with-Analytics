# Lipa Grace Academy Student Performance Monitoring System 

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
<p align="justify">The introduction of digital technologies profoundly affected many facets of
human existence, including education. Recent technological advancements have
presented novel opportunities for enhancing student performance monitoring.
Incorporating technology into educational institutions has brought about a
revolutionary shift in the collection, analysis, and dissemination of educational data.
By leveraging digital platforms, software applications, and analytics tools, schools
can streamline and automate the monitoring of student performance.</p>
<br>
<p align="justify">Lipa Grace Academy is a private school that provides quality education to students in Lipa City, Batangas with a total population of 2,024 students and 57
faculty members from elementary to senior high school. As the school continues to grow, it faces various challenges. The current process of generating weekly reports using a macro spreadsheet and sending them individually through email to the students is time-consuming and prone to errors. Additionally, students cannot view their grades online, and the reports in the macro spreadsheet are only accessible by
the teachers. Therefore, the developers proposed a Mobile-Based Student Performance Monitoring System that can fully address their specific needs. The proposed system aims to provide features such as online viewing of grades and tracking students’ weekly progress of activities and quizzes which can improve the overall learning experience for both students and teachers. By developing a Mobile-based Student Performance Monitoring System that meets the needs of both teachers and students, Lipa Grace Academy aims to contribute to the achievement of SDG 4 which is to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all and provide quality education to its students.</p>

## SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL

<p align="justify">The United Nations recognizes the significance of quality education as a fundamental human right and a catalyst for sustainable development. Hence, it has established Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) to ensure inclusive and equitable education and promote opportunities for lifelong learning for all. Through developing a Student Performance Monitoring that meets the requirements of both
teachers and students, Lipa Grace Academy seeks to contribute to the achievement of SDG 4 and provide its students with a quality education.</p>

## DEVELOPMENT MODEL

<p align="justify">The developers will utilize an agile methodology to ensure the project is completed efficiently. This method is an iterative approach that involves collaboration between cross-functional teams to deliver a product that meets the client's needs. This methodology will allow the project to be completed promptly and efficiently, ensuring that the final product meets the objectives set.</p>

<b>Requirement Analysis</b>
<p align="justify">The Initiation and Requirement Analysis phase of the project begins with the development team investigating into understanding the specific demands and challenges experienced in monitoring student performance at Lipa Grace Academy. To identify the major features and objectives of the Mobile-Based Student Performance Monitoring System, requirements are gathered and prioritized.</p>

<b>Designing</b>
<p align="justify">The team creates the application's blueprint during the Designing phase. To ensure an intuitive and user-friendly design, wireframes and prototypes are created to depict the app's user interface. </p>

<b>Development</b>
<p align="justify">The Development phase focuses on implementing the proposed features and functionalities. The team divides the requirements into smaller tasks and works on them iteratively. To handle any issues and ensure progress is in line with the project timeline, frequent communication and coordination are maintained.</p>

<b>Testing</b>
<p align="justify">The developed functionalities are rigorously tested throughout App Testing and Debugging. Automated tests are implemented to assure code integrity, while manual testing ensures that the application works as it should. Any errors or bugs that are detected are handled as soon as possible to create a robust and reliable application.</p>

<b>Deployment</b>
<p align="justify">The project proceeds to the deployment phase after successful testing and debugging. The Mobile-Based Student Performance Monitoring System is installed and will be accessible to students and teachers in the school. </p>
