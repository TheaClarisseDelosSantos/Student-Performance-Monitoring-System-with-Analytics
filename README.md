# Lipa Grace Academy Student Performance Monitoring System with Analytics

## Project Description
The advent of digital technologies had a profound impact on different facets of human existence, education being one of them. In recent times, technological advancements have presented novel possibilities for improving the monitoring of student performance.<br>
<br>
Lipa Grace Academy is a private school that provides quality education to students in Lipa City, Batangas with a total population of 2,024 students and 57
faculty members from elementary to senior high school. As the school continues to grow, it faces various challenges. The current process of generating weekly reports using a macro spreadsheet and sending them individually through email to the students is time-consuming and prone to errors. Additionally, students cannot view their grades online, and the reports in the macro spreadsheet are only accessible by
the teachers. Therefore, the developers proposed a Mobile-Based Student Performance Monitoring System that can fully address their specific needs. The proposed system aims to provide features such as online viewing of grades and tracking studentsâ€™ weekly progress of activities and quizzes which can improve the overall learning experience for both students and teachers. By developing a Mobile-based Student Performance Monitoring System that meets the needs of both teachers and students, Lipa Grace Academy aims to contribute to the achievement of SDG 4 which is to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all and provide quality education to its students.
